class notes:
* in react, when you change the state, the DOM updates automatcially.
* **in other words, the render method runs again
* when PROPS change, the dom updates with new props magically
* this.setState() is how we change state to manipulate the DOM


* parents pass props to children
    * the parent can just give cash to the child
    * parent has changed their own state (less money)
* children use callbacks to manipulate parent state
    * parent can give the child a debit card
    * the child uses debit card to change the parents bank account
    * parent needs to pass a function as a prop (like giving debit card to child)
* presentational components and container components
* when you refactor into components, you probably need to pass in some props

* when making reusable componets have to ask
    * whats in common (this is our FILE)
        - for our lab both are drop downs
    * whats different (these are our PROPS)
        - currentValue (horns vs keyWord)
        - options (drop down options must be passed as props)
        - handleChange

* in filter method if there are no keyWords and No horns return true
* if there is a keyWord selected but there is no horns, filter match the keyWord
* if there is a horn selected but no keyword, filter matching horns
* if there is both than match on both
* if all checks fail, do not include this item in our filtered array ( return false)
