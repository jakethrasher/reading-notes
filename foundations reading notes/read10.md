### Ch 10
Ch 10 discusses error handling and debugging. Loads of good reference material here. I like how the chapter starts off talking about the call stack and execution context. Hoisting refers to calling functions before they are declared. 
This is because of the exectution context. 
An error object contains the following properties: name, message, filenumber, and line number. There are seven types of error objects: 
    * error
    * syntax error
    * ReferenceError
    * TypeError
    * RangeError
    * URIError
    * EvalError
