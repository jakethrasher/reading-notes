### CSS Positioning
* CSS treats each element as if its own box
* each element has default positioning of static
* either display block or inline
* position: relative;
* position: absolute;
* position: fixed;
* float property

I cant quite get floats to work for me for some reason. need to keep working on this. 

* Fixed position is a type of absolute position. This element remains in a fixed position in the browswer when the user scrolls down the page. Use offset properties to control where the fixed element appears in the browser.

Fixed width layouts are usually accomplished by setting the width values in pixels. 
Liquid layout widths are usually set to percentages.

I did like the idea of the just using the 960 pixel wide / DFD12 column grid as a template
