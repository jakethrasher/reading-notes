* superagent is used to talk to other computers
* super agent is an 'http client'
* whenever making requests from servers you have to use `async` `await`
* our function is labeled async because it does asynchronous work inside (its talking to another server, ie another computer on the internet)
* await the request so that JS knows to stop running until the response comes back
* javascript uses PROMISES to deal with asynchronous stuff
* promise gets resolved or rejected
* request.get() is the promise
* await is awaiting the promise
* async await stops the code until we get the data

*componentDidMount is a place to do things on load
* if you put your propise inside of componentDidMount, remember to add async
