<Route 
path="/pokemon:id" 
exact
render={(routerProps) => <DetailPage {...routerProps} />} 
/>

* the colon on the path says hey our URL is gonna hvae a variable (its a booger)
* have to create a DetailPage component and import in App.js
* at this point typing pokemon/anything-at-all in the URL will take you to the detail page
* must get access to id thats in url for params for api request
* we lean on react router for this info
* `this.props.match.params.id`  // here, id can be whatever! its whatever we call it in the path. params can be multiple things
    * for example pokemon/:booger/:anotherThing/:whatever
* for our purposes we might prefer `this.props.match.params.pokemonName` instead of id ===> actually _id might be best param...up to me to decide
* we have to make an api call in the DetailPage.js component
    * can make componentDidmount and put request in there
    * remember to import request from superagent
    * have to initialize state! Bc detail page is a sibling to listpage, we cant pass state over
    * state contains pokemonData:{} //is an object instead of array-remember this when setting state...
    * our request pulls from params to search for the pokemon
        * `{this.props.match.params.pokemonName}` 

* use ternary to make spinner if state is loading OR render the pokemon object

* make <p> tags with {this.state.pokemonData.OBJECT PROPERTIES SUCH AS IMAGE_URL, DEFENSE, TYPE, ETC}

* on pokeItem, wrap in Link to ={this.props.pokemon}

#### pagination
* the pokedex api gives us pagination
* update fetch call in search page by adding page and perPage
* have to track page in state state{currentPage= 1}
* will utilize buttons to move from page to page => 'next' and 'previous'
    * add onClick to buttons with handlers for next and previous
    * handleNextClick  or handlePreviousClick will increment or decrement state
        * handleNextClick = async()=> {
            //go increment sate
            await this.setState({currentPage: this.state.currentPage + 1});
            //now that state is incremented, make a new fetch
            await this.fetchPokemon();
        }
* however, if youre decrementing currentPage with previous button, you run into a problem if you decrement from page one. 
* you have to disable the 'previous' button by adding disabled={this.state.currentPage===1} to button tag
* we also need to disable the 'next' button on the last page
    * utilize the count property on data
    * add to count to state by {this.setState({totalPokemon:data.body.count
    })}
    * the total count is 801 in our case.
    * create a variable `const lastPage = Math.ceil(this.state.totalPokemon/50);


#### componentDidUpdate
* called whenever state or props change
```
componentDidUpdate =(prevProps, prevState)=>{
    const oldPageNumber = prevState.currentPage;
    const newPageNumber = this.staet.currentPage;

    if(oldPageNumber !== newPageNumber){
        await this.fetchPokemon();
    }
}
```
* with this route, we would remove the await from handleNextClick
