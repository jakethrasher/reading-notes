## slice and splice
* splice is a mutation
    * array.splice(index, how much to delete, 'something you want to inject')
    * array.splice f(1, 0, 'something to inject')
    * splice can return whatever was deleted
    * not a great method because we general like to avoid mutation

* slice
    * makes a copy - immutability
    * just calling slice() on an array makes a copy of an array 
    * array.slice(start at, end at)
        * array.slice(0,2)
        * makes a copy of this part of the array 
        * stops at index 2 
        * returns a copy of items at index 0 and 1

* componentDidMount() is a special word that tells react what to do when a component is first born. its called once when the component first loads

* whenever we do request.get() we will need data.body
* .body is where the information is that we need 
* activeClass name is a special prop we used on NavLink that gives that class to whatever page you happen to be on 

* read about `short circuit conditionals`
