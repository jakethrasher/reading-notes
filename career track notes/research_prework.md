#### *Clean Code* -Robert Martin
* Robert Martin's *Clean Code* Ch 1 is devoted to discussing the importance of clean code. It also discusses the dangers of propagating an 'odious code base.'

* Basically because humans are lazy and pressed for time, we are at risk of creating a code base that is fragile and bug ridden.

* Because the pressure of unrealistic deadlines can result in sloppy code, its important for developers to be upfront with project managers about being able to meet those deadlines and expectations. 

* The chapters goes on to list some definitions of clean code from an array of iconic programmers. 

#### *Test Driven Development By Example* -Kent Beck
#### Preface, Story Time, and Section 1
 * Red, Green, Refactor
    * Red - write a test that doesn't work 
    * Green - make the test work quickly, commiting whatever sins necessary, even copy and pasting code
    * Refactor - remove duplication, clean up
* The tougher the programming problem, the less ground should be covered by each test
* Two major rules of TDD
    * Write a failing automated test   before you write any code
    * Remove duplication

#### Quantity Always Trumps Quality
* Basic idea here: Build things
* stop theorizing and start building
* When you focus more on production you are able to hone in your craft and learn from your mistakes
